* Introduction

This document describes how to build TRE from the darcs repository
sources.  Typical users should use the source code release packages,
available from the TRE website:
  http://laurikari.net/tre/

Building from darcs is necessary for example if you want to test some
of the latest changes before they are offically released.

* Prerequisites

** Unix

You will need the following tools installed on your system:

  - darcs (if you're reading this, you should already have it)
  - autoconf 2.59 or newer
  - automake 1.9.x (newer is usually better)
  - gettext 0.17 or newer
  - libtool 1.5.22 or newer
  - zip (Info-Zip 2.3), optional

** Windows

On Windows building directly from darcs is not supported.  You will
need to get a hold of a Unix system and build a source code release
(see below) and build it on Windows as usual.

* Preparing the tree

Change to the root of the source directory and run
  ./utils/autogen.sh
This will regenerate various things using the prerequisite tools so
that you end up with a buildable tree.

After this, you can run the configure script and build TRE as usual.

* Building a source code package

In a prepared tree, this command creates a source code tarball:
  ./configure && make dist

Alternatively, you can run
  ./utils/build-sources.sh
which builds the source code packages and puts them in the `dist'
subdirectory.  This script needs a working `zip' command.
